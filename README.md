# Dog Art

The Cleveland Museum of Art released an API that opens their art data to the public.
Upon discovering this, I wanted to create a photo library of all pieces of art that included dogs.
Though, due to a fuzzy search on data that isn't the cleanest, after a query for "dog", only 56% of the images had a dog in it.

The API is a work in progress. For more information on this API:
